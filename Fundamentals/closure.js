 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

  /* Task 1: `counterMaker`
   * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
   * 
   * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
   *  counter 1 is creating the count variable in scope 
   *  while counter 2 has the count variable set to global.
   * 
   * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
   *  counter 1 utilizes closure. it calls a function that has a function nested inside of it.
   * 
   * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
   *   counter1: the benefits of using the first function is that you could assign it to a variable and have different variables run the same function simultaneously - let count is protected
   *   counter2: could be used in the case of many functions needing access to the count variable (global)
   *
