                Try typing into the input. You'll see whatever text you type 
                into the input will instantly be reflected in the p tag.

                Similar to above. The key difference here is that we're listening 
                for change events. change events happen whenever a user types 
                something in the input and then unfocuses the input by clicking 
                somewhere else or hitting tab to change the focus. Try typing "red" 
                and then clicking somewhere else. Also, try something that isn't a 
                color. Notice that if you give it an invalid color it just doesn't 
                change anything.

            <h1>Event Delegation</h1>
            <p>
                If you have a bunch of elements that you need to listen for events on, 
                you could attach an event listener to each but that's a bit tedious to 
                do. Instead what is sometimes easier to do is to use what's called event
                 bubbling. When event fires on an element, after that "bubbles" up to its 
                 parent, and then its parent, and its parent, etc. until it's at the root element.
