#ARRAYS
* ordered list of items
* Objects are un-ordered collections of datas using keys and values. Arrays, in contrast, are ordered collections of data. If you put something in an array, it has an order. 
* we declare an array, using [ ]
* Inside of an array, you can store anything you can store in a variable. You can have an array of numbers, an arry of strings, an array of objects, an array of arrays, an array of arrays of arrays, etc.
* To access information in an array we use square brackets and then reference the number that we want to access, the numbering starts at 0, so the first element is index 0.
* Arrays also have many methods (another word for functions that live on an object) and properties (another word for key/value pairs) that live on them.
